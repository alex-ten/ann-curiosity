- Number of face parameters (dimensions): 12. (e.g., nose, mouth, eyes, etc.)
- Range of each parameter: 6. (e.g., there are 6 types of noses, moths, eyes, etc.)
- Number of face recognition units (FRUs): 100
- Simulation starts with 50 "known" faces
- Within-pool inhibotory connections are unchanging

Confidence:
Koriat's SCM:
(1) For each 2AFC item, a maximum number of representations (n) is sampled randomly.
(2) Each representation yields a binary subdecision, favoring one of the two options.
(3) When a sequence of a preset number (n) of representations yields the same subdecision, the sampling is stopped, and that subdecision dictates the choice (see Audley, 1960).
(4) Each subdecision makes an equal contribution to the ultimate, overt decision and to a self-consistency index, which is assumed to underlie subjective confidence.

In our framework, representations are perfipheral features that are more or less consistent with the target feature values. For example, suppose the 2AFC item is a question of whether Art if a Jet (or Shark). Art + Gang will activate features associated with Art. If age "in30s" is activated, it can be "sampled" (in Koriat's terms). The sampling of this representation results in a subdecision favoring the "Sharks" alternative because many Sharks are in 30s while not many of Jets are. This sub-decision-making occurs for several representations until the main decision is made and an alternative is chosen with a level of confidence that corresponds to it's self-conistency.

In IAM, there is not explicit sub-decision-making process. For example, the query `(["Ken"], "Gang")` activates all representations associated with Ken. this includes Ken's age (20s), which is fairly typical for Jets but very atypical for Sharks.
